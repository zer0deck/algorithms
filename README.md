# Python algorithms 2021
This repo contains implementation of search and optimization algorithms in Python 3.9.1 in the Jupiter Notebook library and a number of other tasks from the Alnalysis and Developement of algorithms ITMO University 2021 course.
## Repository navigation
1. Ex1 - located in [Experimental time complexity analysis](https://github.com/zer0deck/py_algorithms/tree/main/Experimental%20time%20complexity%20analysis) folder
2. Ex2-Ex4 - located in [Algorithms for unconstrained nonlinear optimization](https://github.com/zer0deck/py_algorithms/tree/main/Algorithms%20for%20unconstrained%20nonlinear%20optimization) folder
3. Ex5-Ex6 - located in [Algorithms in graphs](https://github.com/zer0deck/py_algorithms/tree/main/Algorithms%20on%20graphs) folder
4. Ex7 - located in [Gephi](https://github.com/zer0deck/py_algorithms/tree/main/Gephi) folder
5. Ex8 - located in [Advanced algorithms](https://github.com/zer0deck/py_algorithms/tree/main/Advanced%20algorithms) folder

<br/>A merged file containing all algorithms is added to each folder after the final task of the group.
## Features of work
Each task completing consist of algorithms' code and GUI part. 
<br/>The whole work is completed on Macbook Air M1 2020 (Apple Silicon 8/8/16) in Anaconda (conda/miniconda/miniforge) environment:
```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda
```
<br/>Due to new ARM Chip specific most of the default mathematical Python libraries are not available in native Python. Therefore, in my situation (for Windows ARM similarly), I recommend using multi-platform third-party solutions like Homebrew or Anaconda.
### Full list of used libraries:
1. NumPy
```
pip install numpy
```
or
```
conda install numpy
```
2. SciPy (optimize and minimize modules)
```
pip install scipy
conda install scipy
```
3. MatPlotLib
```
pip install 'matplotlib>=3.4.2,<3.4.4' --force-install
conda install matplotlib --version==latest
```
4. NetworkX
```
pip install networkx
conda install networkx
```
5. Tkinter
<br/>already integrated in Python 3.9.X package
6. TimeIT
<br/>already integrated in Python 3.9.X package
